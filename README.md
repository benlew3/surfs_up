# Surf's Up Analysis

## Project overview:
This project was to use Pythin, Pandas, SQLAlchemy and ETL methodology to perform an analysis to determine if opening up a surf and ice cream should would be a good fit temperature wise in Oahu.

### Purpose:
By utilizing SQLAlchemy, Python and Pandas, we will be creating statistical research to determine what various temperatures and percipitation of Oahu would be able to support an ice cream and surf shop. we will be using a dataset from the Oahu weather station which records temperatures and precipitation. The data set which we will be analyzing is from 2010 through 2017 to review the climates of June and December. 

## Analysis, Results and ChallengesL

### Outcome:
On the statistics that we have isolated for June and December, we can note the following information. 

#### June and December :
1. When comparing the two datasets of June and December, we can identify that December has more static temperatures which range between 70° to 75°. As we can see in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below, we can see that June's (figure 1) average temperature is about 75° and in December (figure 2) will average only at 71°. From taking the temperature in both summer and winter conditions, with a consistant temperature ranging in the 70s, having low fluctuation of temperature would be able to maintain a stable environment to run a surf and ice cream shop.

2. The temperature ranges between 64° and 85° in June, and for December, it ranges between 56° to 83°. As we can see in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the two extremes can be taken as outliers, with the bulk of the temperature maintaining a range of low 70 to upper 70s. 

As we can see from Figure 1, in June, the lower 25% quartile starts at 73° and the upper range is at 77° with a standard deviation of 3.25. In Figure 2, we can see that December's lower 25% quartile falls at 71° and upper 75% quartile falls at 74° with a standard deviation of 3.75. 

With the majority of the temperatures falling within 71° to 77° throughout the year, this shows strong support that a surf and ice cream shop would be able to maintain business throughout the year based on temperature. 

3. With both Standard Deviations, June being 3.25 and December being 3.75, we can see that the dataset clusters faily close together. The low variability helps to support the idea that the weather is stable which would be benificial to opening the shop. With a more stable temperature, the demand for ice cream and surf boards should also be relatively stable.

### Challenges and Difficulties
No real challenges or difficulties encountered. 

### Ideas to for more complete analysis:
If we were able to identify which seasons or months had higher traffic to the beaches, we would be able to see what the temperatures and weather would be like for higher tourist months and can create a stronger analysis.

## Summary
We have identified that June and December's temerature are fairly static which means for a possible stable flow of customers for the shop year round. The low flux of temperature throughout the year, indicated by researching both mid year and end/beginning of the year which typically would show different climate types. From this analysis, it displays that the temperature becomes more stable later on in the year.
